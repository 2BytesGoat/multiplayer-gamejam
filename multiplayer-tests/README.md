# Tutorial
This project is based on the nakama tutorial video from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3T_ED281vU)

## Setup

1. Give permissions to docker to use your nakama folder - see [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60754297/docker-compose-failed-to-build-filesharing-has-been-cancelled)
2. run `docker-compose up` in the nakama folder (you can use docker directly afterwards)
